##Project description
This project implements a complete end-to-end data pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading using Pandas and Scikit-learn.

The pipeline is designed to handle raw datasets efficiently by:

Cleaning data (handling missing values, outliers)

Transforming features (scaling, encoding categorical variables)

Loading processed data for model training or storage

The goal is to create a reusable and modular workflow that ensures data is prepared consistently for any machine learning task, reducing manual preprocessing efforts and preventing data leakage.

##Key Features

Automated Data Loading

Reads CSV files into Pandas DataFrames

Preprocessing

Missing value imputation (mean for numeric, most_frequent for categorical)

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

One-hot encoding for categorical variables

ColumnTransformer Integration

Apply transformations separately for numeric and categorical columns

Scikit-learn Pipeline

Combines preprocessing and model steps into one workflow

Model Training Example

Demonstrates pipeline usage with a sample classifier (Random Forest)

##Technologies Used

Python 

Pandas — Data loading and manipulation

Scikit-learn — Data preprocessing, pipelines, and modeling

NumPy — Numerical operations
